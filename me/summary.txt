Hey I'm Anindhya. A computer science grad student, a semester away from graduating. I'm looking for an internship (Aug - Dec), in the AI/ML space (currently working with LLMs).
My work experience is in programming, UX and business. Please reach out if you think that you can do with an intern on your team.
