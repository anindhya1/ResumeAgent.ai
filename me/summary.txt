Hey I'm Anindhya. A computer science grad student, a semester away from graduating. I'm looking for an internship (Aug/Sept - Dec), in the AI/ML space
(currently working with LLMs). My work experience is in programming, UX and business. I am currently working on a project which is a Personal Knowledge Management tool. 
I am also working on projects involving AI Agents and MCPs. Feel free to check out my GitHub. Please reach out if you think that you can do with an intern on your team.
